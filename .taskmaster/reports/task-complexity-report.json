			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Scaffold",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup into subtasks for each configuration and setup step, including initializing the repo, configuring TypeScript for Cloudflare Workers, setting up dependencies, directory structure, wrangler.toml, CI/CD, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple setup steps, each with its own configuration and validation requirements. While not algorithmically complex, it covers a broad range of initial project infrastructure and is foundational for the rest of the project."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Slack App Manifest and Registration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for manifest creation, app registration, OAuth scope configuration, event subscriptions, Socket Mode setup, credential storage, and installation documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Registering a Slack app requires careful configuration of scopes, event subscriptions, and secure handling of credentials. Each step is distinct and critical for integration, making the task moderately complex."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Message Transformation Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for service creation, format conversion, special message handling, thread mapping, file URL handling, and user/channel resolution.",
			"reasoning": "Transforming messages while preserving fidelity and metadata requires careful mapping and handling of edge cases, especially with Slack's varied message types."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate with Supermemory API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for API client creation, endpoint integration, retry logic, batch processing, error handling, metrics collection, and rate limiting.",
			"reasoning": "API integration with robust error handling, retries, batching, and metrics is moderately complex and essential for reliable data transfer."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Historical Backfill",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for backfill service creation, pagination, progress tracking, channel selection, document limits, throttling, and thread retrieval.",
			"reasoning": "Backfilling historical data with pagination, rate limits, and resumability is complex due to the need for reliability, efficiency, and error recovery."
